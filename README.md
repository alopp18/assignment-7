Exploring R packages assignment


## Package title
ggplot2

## Location
ggplot2 can be downloaded from both CRAN (https://cloud.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) and GitHub (https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)

## Vignette(s)

There are certainly multiple vignette(s) available for ggplot2. These vignettes cover multiple topics including: extensions of ggplot2, aesthetic specifications, using ggplot2 in packages, etc. 

## Application(s)
ggplot2 is obviously a huge package with endless applications. Whether it be websites, cheatsheets, twitter, tutorials, instructive courses, books, etc., ggplot2, and how to best utilize ggplot2, can be found across all platforms. With this in mind, the applications have become extensive.  

## Review

In short, ggplot2 is used as a tool for data visualization for the R statistical programming language. This is a package that is used widely across all data science sectors, with a global reach. I understand that this certainly a well-known package (impossible to describe in >300 words), but it is one that I use often and is the package that really introduced to R programming. While there are pros and cons of each, in general I would say I prefer ggplot2 over base Râ€™s data visualization formatting. With ggplot2, you are given a higher degree of freedom to progressively modify graphic output by adding different layers and scales to your base graph. This, coupled with the incredible diversity of add-ons and visualizations options, are my main reasonings for enjoying this package. I would absolutely recommend this package to any person interested in learning/utilizing data visualization, no matter your level of experience in programming. The breadth of available resources to help you learn the basics of ggplot2 allows one to generate publication worthy graphics relatively quickly. In my case, I used ggplot2 with no prior experience, and was able to generate plots that were incorporated into a publication as an undergraduate. As someone with very little programming experience, I look forward to furthering my understanding of ggplot2 and learning more about the plethora of packages to be used in R.
